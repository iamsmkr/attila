# Attila

A content focused responsive theme for [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/).

**Notes:** This project is forked from `zutrinken/attila`. However, it is now maintained personally for my blog hosted at http://www.shivamkapoor.com/. It means that this repository doesn't resonate with the original repository including the project structuring and the grunt tasks.

## Setup

To enable [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) comments go to your blogs code injection settings and add `<script>var disqus = 'YOUR_DISQUS_SHORTNAME';</script>` to your blog header.

## Develop/Deploy

### 1. Install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started/)
```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```
npm install
```

### 3. Stage/Test Project
```
grunt stage
```

This step create an unarchived version of the theme under `stage/attila`. The softlink to which could be created under ghost installation directory `ghost/content/theme` for developement and testing purposes.


### 4. Build Project
```
grunt build
```

This step creates a distribution zip.

### 5. Deploy
Upload zip created in `Step 4` using Ghost admin panel under `Settings/Design/Upload a theme`

## Notes

1. Ghost requires `package.json` as part of the build to pick up configurations required for your theme defined under `config` json object.
	```
	"config": {
	    "posts_per_page": 10 // Number of posts shown per page
	}
	```

2. To add a custom page to your blog, add a new route under `routes:` key in `routes.yaml` file.
	```
	routes:
	  /tags/:
	    template: tags
	```

	Here, the first part is the url `/tags/` and the second part is the template which will be used `tags.hbs`. Ghost interprest `.hbs` by itself, hence mentioning `tags` it enough.
